# Results

The results in the this repository corresponds to the main run presented in the paper (stratified epithelial ODP with PKP1) and two auxiliary runs (stratified epithelium with PKP3 and basal epithelium). Each run-specific folder contains the localization densitites, the cluster center model and the chimera visualization script (same in all the runs). The final set of filtered good-scoring models used for analysis are available as a single RMF file per run on [Zenodo](link). Also included are the results of the alphafold analysis (see [scripts README](https://github.com/isblab/desmosome/blob/main/scripts/README.md)).
